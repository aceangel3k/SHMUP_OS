# Step 8: Player, Weapons, Bullets

## What Was Built

### Engine Modules (`frontend/src/engine/`)

1. **BulletManager.js** (160 lines)
   - Object pooling for 1000 bullets
   - Player and enemy bullet support
   - Automatic off-screen deactivation
   - Bullet rendering with glow effects
   - Clear functions (all, enemy only)

2. **WeaponSystem.js** (110 lines)
   - Fire rate control (bullets per second)
   - Single shot and spread patterns
   - Weapon upgrades (5 levels)
   - Configurable from game data
   - Automatic firing when Space held

3. **BombSystem.js** (110 lines)
   - Expanding circle animation (500ms)
   - Clears all enemy bullets instantly
   - Visual effects (expanding ring, glow, flash)
   - Pink/magenta color (#FF00D1)
   - Damage radius for enemies (future use)

4. **CollisionManager.js** (120 lines)
   - Circle-circle collision detection
   - Point-circle collision
   - Player-bullet collision checking
   - Bullet-enemy collision checking
   - Player-enemy collision checking
   - Bomb radius checking

### Integration

**GameView.jsx** - Updated with weapon systems
- BulletManager initialized with 1000 bullet pool
- WeaponSystem reads from game data
- BombSystem integrated with X key
- Bomb counter (starts at 3)
- Power level display
- Active bullet count display

## Validation Tests

### 1. Firing Bullets
```
Controls: Hold SPACE to fire

Expected:
- Bullets spawn from front of player ship
- Cyan bullets with glow effect
- Fire rate: ~10 bullets per second (default)
- Bullets move right at 800 px/s
- Bullets disappear off-screen
- Bullet count shown in top-left (e.g., "Bullets: 15")
```

### 2. Fire Rate
```
Test: Hold SPACE continuously

Expected:
- Consistent firing rhythm
- No missed shots
- ~10 bullets per second
- Smooth bullet stream
```

### 3. Bomb Mechanic
```
Controls: Press X to use bomb

Expected:
- Pink/magenta expanding circle from player
- Circle expands to full screen in 500ms
- Fades out as it expands
- Console logs "ðŸ’£ BOMB! (X remaining)"
- Bomb counter decreases (shown in HUD)
- Can only use 3 bombs total
- Pressing X with 0 bombs does nothing
```

### 4. Bullet Pooling
```
Test: Hold SPACE and watch bullet count

Expected:
- Bullet count increases while firing
- Bullet count decreases as bullets go off-screen
- Maximum ~100-150 active bullets at once
- No performance degradation
- FPS stays at 60
```

### 5. Movement While Firing
```
Test: Hold SPACE + move with WASD/Arrows

Expected:
- Can move and fire simultaneously
- Bullets spawn from player position
- No input lag
- Smooth movement
```

### 6. Slow Mode While Firing
```
Test: Hold SPACE + SHIFT

Expected:
- Bullets continue firing
- Player moves slower
- Pink hitbox visible
- Fire rate unchanged
```

## Technical Details

### Weapon Stats (Default)
```javascript
fire_rate: 10          // Bullets per second
projectile_speed: 800  // Pixels per second
damage: 10             // Damage per bullet
bullet_count: 1        // Single shot
spread_angle: 0        // No spread
```

### Weapon Upgrades
- **Level 1**: 10 bullets/s, single shot
- **Level 2**: 12 bullets/s, single shot
- **Level 3**: 12 bullets/s, 2-way spread (10Â°)
- **Level 4**: 15 bullets/s, 3-way spread (15Â°)
- **Level 5**: 20 bullets/s, 3-way spread (20Â°)

### Bullet Pool
- Pool size: 1000 bullets
- Reuses inactive bullets (object pooling)
- No garbage collection during gameplay
- Bullets auto-deactivate when off-screen (50px margin)

### Bomb Stats
```javascript
duration: 500ms        // Animation duration
maxRadius: 800px       // Full screen coverage
color: #FF00D1         // Pink/magenta
```

### Performance
- Object pooling prevents GC pauses
- Circle-circle collision: O(n) per frame
- Target: 60 FPS with 100+ active bullets

## File Structure

```
frontend/src/engine/
â”œâ”€â”€ BulletManager.js      (NEW - 160 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ WeaponSystem.js       (NEW - 110 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ BombSystem.js         (NEW - 110 lines)

â””â”€â”€ GameView.jsx          (UPDATED - weapon integration)
```

## Controls Summary

- **SPACE**: Fire weapon (hold for continuous fire)
- **X**: Use bomb (clears enemy bullets)
- **SHIFT**: Slow mode (while firing)
- **WASD/Arrows**: Move while firing

## Known Limitations (MVP)

- No enemy bullets yet (Step 9)
- No collision damage yet (Step 9)
- Bomb doesn't damage enemies yet (Step 9)
- No weapon upgrades UI (future)
- No score system yet (Step 11)

## Next Steps

- Step 9: Enemies, Waves, Paths (enemy spawning, formations, movement)
- Step 10: Boss & Patterns (boss controller, bullet patterns)
- Step 11: TUI Overlay & HUD (score, lives, multiplier)
