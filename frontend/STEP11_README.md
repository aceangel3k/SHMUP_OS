## Technical Details

### TUI Effects

  0deg,
  rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 0px,
  transparent 1px,
  transparent 2px,
  rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 3px
);
opacity: 0.3;
```

**CRT Glow**:
```css
box-shadow: 
  inset 0 0 100px rgba(0, 255, 209, 0.1),
  inset 0 0 50px rgba(0, 255, 209, 0.05);
```

**Vignette**:
```css
background: radial-gradient(
  circle at center,
  transparent 0%,
  transparent 60%,
  rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) 100%
);
```

### Lives System

**Invulnerability**:
- Duration: 2 seconds
- Triggered on hit

- Timer decreases with deltaTime

**Damage Sources**:

### Boot Log Messages

```javascript

  'Weapons system online',
  'All systems operational',
]
```
