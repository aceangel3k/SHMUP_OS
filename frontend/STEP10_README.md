# Step 10: Bullet Patterns & Boss Phases

## What Was Built

### Engine Modules (`frontend/src/engine/`)

1. **BulletPattern.js** (140 lines)
   - Pattern spawning system for enemy/boss bullets
   - 11 predefined patterns:
     - `fan_3`, `fan_5`, `fan_7` - N-way spread (30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°)
     - `burst_16`, `burst_32`, `burst_64` - 360Â° ring
     - `spiral_single`, `spiral_dual`, `spiral_triple` - Rotating spirals
     - `aimed` - Single bullet aimed at player (gold color)
     - `ring` - Circle of bullets (12 bullets)
   - Pattern rotation support
   - Configurable speed and color

2. **Boss.js** (280 lines)
   - Boss entity with multiple phases
   - HP-based phase transitions
   - Attack pattern execution
   - Large HP bar at top of screen
   - Movement to position then attack
   - Phase cooldowns
   - Placeholder sprite (magenta circle with "BOSS" text)
   - Damage flash effect

### Integration

**WaveScheduler.js** - Updated with boss support
- Boss spawning after all waves complete
- Boss update and rendering
- Boss included in active enemies list
- Console logs "ðŸ‘¹ BOSS SPAWNED: [name]"
- Console logs "ðŸ‘¹ Boss phase X: [phase_name]"

**GameView.jsx** - Updated with bullet pattern system
- BulletPattern initialized
- Passed to WaveScheduler for boss attacks
- Boss bullets rendered and collide with player

## Validation Tests

### 1. Boss Spawning
```
Expected:
- Boss spawns after all enemy waves complete
- Console logs "ðŸ‘¹ BOSS SPAWNED: [name]"
- Boss moves from right side to center-right
- Large HP bar appears at top of screen
- Boss name displayed above HP bar
```

### 2. Boss Phases
```
Test: Damage boss to trigger phase transitions

Expected:
- Boss starts in Phase 1
- At HP threshold (e.g., 50%), transitions to Phase 2
- Console logs "ðŸ‘¹ Boss phase 2: [phase_name]"
- Attack patterns change based on phase
- Cooldown resets on phase change (immediate attack)
```

### 3. Bullet Patterns
```
Test each pattern by observing boss attacks:

fan_5: 5-way spread (45Â° angle)
burst_32: 360Â° ring of 32 bullets
spiral_dual: 2 rotating spiral arms
aimed: Gold bullet aimed at player position

Expected:
- Patterns spawn from boss position
- Bullets are red (#FF6B6B) except aimed (gold #FFD700)
- Patterns rotate over time (30Â°/second)
- Bullets move at specified speed (200 px/s default)
```

### 4. Boss HP Bar
```
Expected:
- Large bar at top center (400px wide, 20px tall)
- Shows boss name above bar
- Shows "HP / MaxHP" text in center
- Color changes: green â†’ yellow â†’ red
- Updates in real-time as boss takes damage
```

### 5. Boss Attacks
```
Expected:
- Boss attacks based on phase cooldown (e.g., every 2 seconds)
- Multiple patterns can fire simultaneously
- Pattern rotation increases over time
- Attacks stop when boss moving to position
```

### 6. Boss Defeat
```
Test: Reduce boss HP to 0

Expected:
- Boss destroyed at 0 HP
- Console logs "ðŸ‘¹ Boss defeated!"
- Boss disappears
- Score increases (100 points)
- Stage complete
```

## Technical Details

### Boss Data Structure (JSON)
```javascript
{
  id: "boss_1",
  name: "Core Sentinel",
  hp: 1000,
  radius: 40,
  sprite_prompt: "...",
  phases: [
    {
      name: "Phase 1",
      hp_threshold: 0.5,  // Transition at 50% HP
      cooldown: 2.0,       // 2 seconds between attacks
      patterns: ["fan_5", "burst_16"]
    },
    {
      name: "Phase 2",
      hp_threshold: 0,     // Final phase
      cooldown: 1.5,
      patterns: ["spiral_dual", "aimed"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pattern Parameters
- **Fan**: `count` (3/5/7), `spreadAngle` (30Â°/45Â°/60Â°)
- **Burst**: `count` (16/32/64), 360Â° spread
- **Spiral**: `arms` (1/2/3), rotating
- **Aimed**: Single bullet, player-seeking
- **Ring**: 12 bullets, circular

### Pattern Colors
- Enemy bullets: Red (#FF6B6B)
- Aimed bullets: Gold (#FFD700)
- Bullet radius: 4-5px

### Boss Behavior
1. **Spawn**: Appears from right side
2. **Move**: Moves to position (200px from right edge)
3. **Attack**: Fires patterns based on phase
4. **Phase Transition**: Changes phase at HP thresholds
5. **Defeat**: Destroyed at 0 HP

### Pattern Rotation
- Rotation speed: 30Â° per second
- Applied to all patterns
- Creates dynamic bullet patterns

## File Structure

```
frontend/src/engine/
â”œâ”€â”€ BulletPattern.js  (NEW - 140 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ Boss.js           (NEW - 280 lines)
â””â”€â”€ WaveScheduler.js  (UPDATED - boss integration)

frontend/src/components/
â””â”€â”€ GameView.jsx      (UPDATED - bullet pattern system)
```

## Controls Summary

- **SPACE**: Fire at boss
- **WASD/Arrows**: Dodge boss bullets
- **SHIFT**: Slow mode (precise dodging)
- **X**: Bomb (clears boss bullets)

## Known Limitations (MVP)

- No player lives/damage system yet (Step 11)
- Placeholder boss sprite (magenta circle)
- No boss death animation
- No victory screen
- Boss bullets don't damage player yet (logs to console)

## Next Steps

- Step 11: TUI Overlay & HUD (lives system, damage, game over)
- Step 12: Asset Integration (boss sprites, sound effects)
- Step 13: Polish & Effects (explosions, particles, screen shake)
